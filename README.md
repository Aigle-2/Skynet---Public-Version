# Skynet---Public-Version
Skynet is a tensorflowJS based platform to configure, build, train, and evaluate neural networks models.

It was designed when I worked at Mr Suricate, and has a modular architecture. 
This public version has been filtered a company-owned data, and serves as a demonstration project for my skills.
